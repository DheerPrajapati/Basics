Q.) What is your favorite programming language? Why?
    A.) My favorite programming language is java because it was one of the first language that I leanred
     and since I have so much experience in the language I find it 
     very easy to manage since I know a majority of the helpful packages and methods that I can use and 
     also I have very familiar with OOP. I also like how the syntax of java is so restrictive which makes it better for not making mistakes.



Q.) Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?
    A.) Yes my favorite language is the one that i am the most experience with.
